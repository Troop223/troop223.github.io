-------

Next, find the grey line below that says 'Paste template here'. Paste it there.

Once the Troop has come back from the trip, copy and delete the filled out template and scroll down under the 'Previous Trips' section and paste the Filled out template there.

Paste the template, and starting with the bottem, fill out all the fields until you get to the top, LEAVING the sections that have '<th>' and '</th>' surrounding them. Make sure to include all meetings of the month in the Template, so as an example if there are technically five meetings in the month instead of four, copy and paste a section with '<tr>' and '</tr>' with Date, Description and Location to add another line.
