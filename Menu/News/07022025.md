# Skymont 2025!

<hr>

## Survivalism is great, but the aspect of community and general Scouting skills is incredible to watch. I hope that this continues to grow and our Troop enlarges itself some more. Lets Be Prepared!

### 2 survival
The skills Scouts learn in first aid is irreplaceable, and it looks like they did a great job! Plus
being able to cary someone is incredibly helpful. Hopefully they won't need it, but if so, they'll be prepaired! And hey
there are many different ways to move people, with so many to learn. I expect a demonstration soon!

### 4 scouting skills
Being able to take leadership is helpful for scouting objectives, because things need to get done around here! Plus, it helps in the supervision in things like art projects.
Refining the skills of art is helpful, not just for the preperation of future artists (of which I see several here), but also for keeping your mind young. Keep learning!
Its also fun that they worked together with another troop/patrol, wish I was there!
