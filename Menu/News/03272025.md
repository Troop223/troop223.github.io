<h2>This happens only about twice a year, so savor the momunt! <br></h2>

  <h4>
A very experianced Scout in the Troop, who I will refer to as D, has passed his Eagle Board of review, meaning he is now an Eagle Scout.<br>
I know he has personelly worked VERY hard on this achievement, and I am proud to say he has joined the echelons of Eagles our Troop has created. way to go D! <br>
As of now, the Eagle ceremony is still being planned, but stick around for this epic party to ensue! Again we are so pround to call you an Eagle D, great job!
